# Kakao-Clone Overview

During the process of working on the Indeed_StackOverflow_Web_Scraper project, I became curious about HTML elements such as <a>, <div>, and others that make up HTML, as well as the components that establish it using CSS. This curiosity led me to realize that with just a grasp of HTML and CSS, I could create my own webpages. Intrigued by this idea, I decided to clone the design of the Kakao Talk page, which I frequently use.
